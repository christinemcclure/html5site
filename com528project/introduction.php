    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>About Me as a Designer...</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a librarian. And while the nature of my work in digital services means that I rarely ever touch a book, I still exhibit many of
        the profession's classic tendencies. My CDs are alphabetized; I edit work-related emails and Facebook posts with equal fervor, and I favor the rule-of-three
        when making a list.
    </p>
    <p>
      My designs tend to be very precise. It's not that I don't ever color outside the lines, I do. But when I do, I take care to convey the idea
      that I know <em>exactly where those lines are, dammit</em>, and so this is intentional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a drawing class a few years ago. My final project was an intricate ink drawing of a field of lilies at night, hundreds of them, with two that had opened in the moonlight.
      The professor's comment:
      <blockquote>
        I love this--it's so obsessive!
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm OK with that.

    <h2>The elements of this portfolio</h2>
    <p>This portfolio consists of various assignments from a Document Design class I took as part of the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/psych/hum/programs/grad/iarc.shtml">Information
        Architecture</a> curriculum at Illinois Institute of Technology. Here's a brief description of each assignment included here:

        <a href="draw-letters.php">Drawing Letterforms</a>: recreate--by hand drawing or using graphic software, the following letters: "A," "a," and "<em>a</em>--as shown in the Adobe Garamond font."
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="words.php">Words</a>: Use two of the following words and convey the design concepts of space and meaning by modifying only the font size, spacing and/or placement of the letters.
