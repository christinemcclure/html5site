    <h1>About Me as a Designer...</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a librarian. And while the nature of my work in digital services means that I rarely ever touch a book, I still exhibit many of
        the profession's classic tendencies.
      My CDs are alphabetized; I edit work-related emails and Facebook posts with equal fervor, and I favor the rule-of-three 
      in my writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      My designs tend to be very precise. It's not that I don't ever color outside the lines, I do. But when I do, I take care to convey the idea
      that I know <em>exactly where those lines are, dammit</em>, and so this is intentional.
    </p>

      I took a drawing class a few years ago.
      The professor's comment on my final project was:
      <blockquote>
        I love this--it's so obsessive!
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm OK with that.
