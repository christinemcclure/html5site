    Working in a 6 x 6 inch square, arrange three of four geometric elements (circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, etc) in a symmetrical way.
    Start with variations in which all the elements are the same size, then create symmetrical designs with elements of different size. Experiment with scale and cropping.</li>
