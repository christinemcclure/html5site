    <h2>About Me as a Designer...</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a librarian. And while the nature of my work in digital services means that I rarely ever touch a book, I still exhibit many of
        the profession's classic tendencies. My CDs are classified by genre; I edit work-related emails and Facebook posts with equal fervor; and I favor the rule-of-three
        in my writing style.

      My designs tend to be very precise. It's not that I don't ever color outside the lines, I do. But when I do, I take care to convey the idea
      that I know <em>exactly where those lines are, dammit</em>, and so this is intentional.

      I took a drawing class a few years ago. My final project was an intricate ink drawing of a field of lilies at night, hundreds of them, with two that had opened in the moonlight.
      The professor's comment:
      <blockquote>
        I love this--it's so obsessive!
      </blockquote>

      I'm OK with that.
