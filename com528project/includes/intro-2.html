My designs tend to be very precise. It's not that I don't ever color outside the lines, I do. But when I do, I take care to convey the idea
that I know exactly where those lines are, dammit, and so this is intentional.

I took a drawing class a few years ago. My final project was an intricate ink drawing of a field of lillies at night&mdash;hundreds of them&mdash;with two that had opened in the moonlight.
The instructor's comment was:
<blockquote>
  I love this&mdash;it's so obsessive!
</blockquote>

I'm OK with that.
