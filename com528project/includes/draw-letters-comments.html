<p>I created this in Adobe Illustrator with the pen tool, tracing over the original bitmapped elements to recreate as precise a replication as possible. </p>
<p>Pretty close, but I could use some more practice: I can draw a simple image with the pen tool,
  but trying to go back and edit anchor points later on is where all hell breaks loose for me.
