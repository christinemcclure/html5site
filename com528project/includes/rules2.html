After deciding to drop small
screen support (can you imagine viewing this on a phone?), I chose to focus on a responsive design by changing sizes, margins, and padding while
allowing the layout to remain fluid.

<p>
Using a PDF would have alleviated the layout problems I encountered. PDF provides a framework that can render a project precisely
as the designer meant it to be viewed. It can be viewed online or printed in physical form and look the same in each instance. But for a
portfolio like mine, which will only live online, it seems like cheating to deploy a non-native format like a PDF in a browser and hold your
viewers accountable for supporting it.
</p>

<p>
Using fluid HTML rather than the rigid structure a PDF provides forces you to give up some control,
but it adds scalability and search engine optimization without requiring the viewer to install additional items to the browser.

<p>
  Yes, a PDF would have done nicely, but it's not nearly as appealing as an eloquently written JavaScript function.
