Choosing to make an e-book in an HTML page created the randomness. The infinite number of screen sizes and aspect ratios can be
frustrating, and you must consider how text and images flow across the pages at several different viewpoints.

After deciding to drop small
screen support (can you imagine this on a phone?), I chose to focus on a responsive design by changing sizes, margins, and padding while
allowing the layout to remain fluid.

Using a PDF would have alleviated the layout problems I encountered. PDF provides a framework that can render a project precisely
as the designer meant it to be viewed. It be viewed online or printed in physical form and look the same in each instance. But for a
portfolio like mine, which will only live online, it seems like cheating to deploy a non-native format like a PDF in a browser and hold your
viewers accountable for supporting it.
