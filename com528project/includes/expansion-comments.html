The normal association with this word seems to be to get larger...fatter--probably due to the overused phrase "expanding waistlines."
But one definition of expand is simply "growth," and when I think of growth, I think of kudzu. Kudzu is a vine native to South America that was planted along riverbanks in the southern United States in an ill-fated attempt to reduce soil erosion.
It quickly grew far beyond the original intent, and now large swaths of the South are covered in kudzu. I wanted to simulate the illusion of growth with the word, and so I used the Illustrator pen tool to make curvy lines, then used these as type guidelines to direct the flow of text, using a single letter when the paths crossed.
