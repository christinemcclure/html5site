  <blockquote id="text-quote">
    Print situates words in space more relentlessly than writing ever did. Writing moves words from the sound world to a world of visual space,
    but print locks words into position in this space. Control of position is everything in print. Printed texts look machine-made, as they are.
    In handwriting, control of space tends to be ornamental, ornate, as in calligraphy. Typographic control typically impresses most by its tidiness
    and invisibility: the lines perfectly regular, all justified on the right side, everything coming out even visually, and without the aid of
    guidelines or ruled borders that often occur in manuscripts. This is an insistent world of cold, non-human, facts.
