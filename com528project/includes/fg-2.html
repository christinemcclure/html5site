  I decided to treat these three images as a series and so used the same color scheme for each.

I started with the reversible image because I wanted to create two separate images. Not as a
repeating pattern, but something more organic. I searched online for basic icon images and
looked at the negative spaces to see if another image was suggested. I saw a bird outline
in one fleur&ndash;di&ndash;lis icon, and decided to try and make a flower out of
several bird silhouettes.

I then created a simple, stylized bird outline for the stable image, and zoomed in on
my reversible image for the ambiguous.
