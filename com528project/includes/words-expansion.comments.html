<h2>comments&mdash;expansion</h2>
<p>
The normal association with the word expansion is to get larger. Another is simply: "growth," and when I think of growth, I think of kudzu.

Kudzu is a vine native to South America that was planted along riverbanks in the southern United States in an ill-fated attempt to
reduce soil erosion. It quickly grew far beyond the original intent, and now large swaths
of the South are covered in it. I wanted to simulate the illusion of growth with the word,
and so I used curved lines as type guidelines to direct the flow of text.
