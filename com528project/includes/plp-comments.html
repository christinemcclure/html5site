  I turned to my archives for this assignment; there was no need to take new images when I have a
  library of over 10,000 already. I decided to challenge myself and find images that would make
  a series that could be displayed together.

  The images I chose were taken with a macro lens of three different types of succulent plants
  at the Garfield Park Conservatory. I adjusted the contrast so that the images more closely
  matched each other in tone, and I moved the "plane" image to the center to balance out the
  harsh contrast of the other images. I see it as a calming influence between the spikes and
  barbs of the other two because I see in it a hooded figure holding an infant, protecting it.
