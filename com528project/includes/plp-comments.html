  When I saw that this assignment required images, the work for me turned from photographer to archivist: there was no need to take new images
  when I have a library of over 10,000 already as a photographer. I decided to challenge myself and find images that would make a series that could be displayed together.

  The images I chose were taken with a macro lens three different types of succulent plants in the desert room of the Garfield Park Conservatory. I adjusted the contrast so that the images more closely matched each other in tone, and I moved the "plane" image to the center to balance out the harsh contrast of the other images. I see it as a calming influence between the spikes and barbs of the other two because I see a hooded figure holding an infant--protecting it--in that image.
