<h2>comments&mdash;contraction</h2>
<p>
I wanted to use the secondary definition of the word contraction&mdash;to replace a letter&mdash;and
thought the second "t" would be a good candidate.  The "ion" sound is almost automatic, and
the "t" looks somewhat like an apostrophe already.

My live-in roving critic (aka spouse) wandered by as I was testing fonts and offered some
helpful, if unsolicited, advice of using a narrower font. I agreed because it suggested the
primary definition of contraction as well.
