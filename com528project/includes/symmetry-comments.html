  The Symmetry example is a play on the idea of predictive vision. I wanted to create an image that was both symmetrical and asymmetrical. I decided to use circles,
  and then size and place them so that they were just outside of the image area, meaning: they're not actually circles within the context of the image area, 
  but our brains would read them as circles. I reinforced the boundaries of the image area by adding an outline. Even though I myself know these aren't quite 
  circles, my own brain makes up the difference and that's what I see when I look at the image.
