  I was right: by the time I was finished, I had borrowed doll furniture from friends, constructed a set,
  and drafted a reluctant assistant into helping with the lighting.

  I shot this with a macro lens which helps bring small items into a larger scale but magnifies
  every imperfection in the scene. I kept reshooting to straighten fabric, straighten a wall,
  etc. The lighting was crucial to making the scene appear in normal scale: the light source
  had to appear natural for the setting, which meant trying various flashlights and funnels
  until a soft, atmospheric light appeared that cast shadows under the piano.
