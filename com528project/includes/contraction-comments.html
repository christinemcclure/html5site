This is a more simple design. I had the idea of using the secondary definition of the word (replace a letter), and thought the second "t" would be a good candidate to remove and make into an apostrophe--the "ion" sound is almost automatic, and the "t" looks somewhat like an apostrophe already.
My live-in roving critic (spouse) wandered by as I was testing fonts and offered some helpful, if unsolicited, advice of using a narrower font.
I agreed because it suggested the primary definition of contraction as well. I couldn't decide on the ideal size or tilt of the t-as-apostrophe until I literally typed out "contrac'ion" in Arial Narrow. This showed me that the apostrophe
isn't slanted at all, and let me choose the correct size and placement for the mark.
