I have many photos from the natural world that would have served well for texture examples, but
chose two man&ndash;made textures instead. One is an aluminum bronze roof covered in gold leaf, each tile
perfectly symmetrical. The other is hand-painted mosaic tiles, uneven in size, roughly hewn
and worn. They add a physical texture to the visual scene.

The textures are very dissimilar. And so are the colors: the blues and golds are near opposites
on the color wheel. But what I enjoy about this piece is that they are two images of the same
building: the Dome of the Rock shrine in Jerusalem.
