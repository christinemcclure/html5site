<h1>rules and randomness</h1>
<h4>What is a book?</h4>
<p>
  That was the first set of rules I had to come up with for this project. I always knew this portfolio would be in web form, but what,
  exactly, would make it a book? I considered things like verso pages and numbering, but decided that&mdash;to me&mdash;an online book would need
  to have the same visual elements as a physical one: a spine, pages that turn, and front and back covers.

  The <a href="builtbywill.com/code/booklet/â€Ž">jQuery booklet plugin</a> solved one of those problems, while Adobe Illustrator and
  JavaScript programming helped me with the others.

Crafting the e-book in an HTML page created the randomness. The infinite number of screen sizes and aspect ratios can be
frustrating, and you must consider how text and images flow across the pages at many different viewpoints.
