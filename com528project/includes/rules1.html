<h1>rules and randomness</h1>
<h4>What is a book?</h4>
<p>
  That was the first set of rules I had to come up with for this project. I always knew this portfolio would be in web form, but what,
  exactly, would make it a book? I considered things like verso pages and numbering, but decided that&mdash;to me&mdash;an online book would need
  to have the visual elements of a physical one: a spine, turning pages, front and back covers.

  The <a href="builtbywill.com/code/booklet/â€Ž">Jquery booklet plugin</a> solved one of those problems, while Adobe Illustrator and
  JavaScript programming helped me with the rest.
