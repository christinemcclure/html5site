<h2>comments&mdash;asymmetry</h2>
<p>
  I wanted to show color as an anchor, and that the lack of color causes the other squares to
  "drift away." There is a direct correlation between the size of each square and the amount of
  desaturation it has to help convey the idea. </p>
<p>I also stacked the images so that the order was
  that largest square was at the bottom (and so on) to give the impression of time: the longer
  a square is around, the larger and more desaturated it becomes.
