  When I saw this assignment, I immediately thought of the transparency layer in CSS and how I could use it for 
  my table of contents. I decided to focus on creating a background image that would be highlighted by transparent cutouts of my various assignments.

  I was able to create a function to swap out images easily enough and reuse code. Then I started playing with different ways to bring the highlighted assignment to the forefront.
