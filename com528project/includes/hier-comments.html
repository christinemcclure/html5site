Since the first iterations of my project were code based and didn't focus on font and colors, I had to make those decisions first. I like the colourlovers.com site for ideas on color schemes, and I took a couple of options from there to start with. I limited my font options to those available from those hosted by Google.

I think the second design works best: the third is too busy and the first seems indecisive. I also made the headings and quote semi-transparent to ease the heaviness of the font and size; the background image showing through the headers is a nice subtle effect.
