<h3>symmetry</h3>
<p>
  This is an example of predictive vision. I wanted to create an image that was both
  symmetrical and asymmetrical&mdash;. I decided to use circles and then size and place
  them so that they were just outside of the image area. They are unnamed planes within the
  context of the image area, but the brain reads them as circles.

  Even though I myself know these aren't circles, my own brain makes up the difference
  and that's what I see.
