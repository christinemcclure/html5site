I have many photos from the natural world that would have served well for texture examples, but
chose two man&ndash;made textures instead. One is an aluminum bronze roof covered in gold leaf, each tile
perfectly symmetrical. The other is of hand-painted mosaic tiles, uneven in size and roughly hewn
and worn, adding a physical texture to the visual texture.
