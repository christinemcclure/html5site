  <p>Create asymmetrical designs using forms of different sizes. Experiment until you find visual balance in each composition. For example, use several small elements to
    offset one larger one.

    Many variations are possible. Introduce contrasts of color or value. Create a simple animation of one or more designs; make a stable design become active, or bring order to a seemingly random arrangement.
