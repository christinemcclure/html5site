<h2>About Me as a Designer...</h2>
<p>
  I'm a librarian. And while the nature of my work in digital services means that I rarely ever touch a book, I still exhibit many of
  the profession's classic tendencies. My CDs are classified by genre; I edit work-related emails and Facebook posts with equal fervor; and I favor the rule-of-three
  in my writing style.
