<h2>about me as a designer</h2>
<p>
  I'm a librarian. And while the nature of my work in digital services means that I rarely ever touch a book, I still exhibit many of
  the profession's classic tendencies:</p>
<ul class="intro">
  <li>My CDs are classified by genre;</li>
  <li>I edit work-related emails and Facebook posts with equal fervor;</li>
  <li>and I favor the rule-of-three in my writing style.</li>
</ul>
