  Within a 6 x 6-inch square, compose the text provided below* in a manner that expresses its meaning. Use Garamond only.**
  Use variations in alignment, leading, line length, orientation, and spacing. Avoid variations in weight (no boldface) or size (larger and smaller font sizes).
  You may break the paragraph into smaller elements and distribute them within the square.
  Be sure to have a concept in mind as you work.

  **If you do not have Garamond installed on your computer, acceptable alternative typefaces: Times, Times New Roman, Georgia.
  If you don't have any of these fonts installed on your computer choose a traditional serif font.
