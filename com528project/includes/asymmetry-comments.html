  The Asymmetry image is anchored by a small square in full color in one corner, with additional squares of varying sizes and saturation levels floating off to
  the right of the image. I wanted to show color as an anchor, and the lack of color causes the other squares to "drift away." There is a direct correlation
  between the size of each square and the amount of desaturation it has to help convey the idea. I also stacked the images so that the order was that largest
  square was at the bottom (and so on) to give the impression of time: the longer a square is around, the larger and more desaturated it becomes.
