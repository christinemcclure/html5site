    I decided to choose certain words to highlight in the text that would create an additional message. I did this by popping out certain of the stronger words:
    relentlessly, machine-made, non-human facts. Once I realized I was constructing a Borg-like statement, I decided to make the format as machine-like as possible.
    This involved modifying the line height of the larger words so that they still matched the line height of the paragraphs and playing with the paragraph
    tracking so that it wasn't disruptive in a fully justified setting.

    I also took some creative license with hyphenation and grammar: "relentlessly" didn't make sense to the message, so I bumped the "-ly" down to the next line.
    I also moved the large-type hyphens to the beginning of the the second word, instead of the first; they were less intrusive that way. Finally, I arranged the
    different blocks so that the same narrow margin was used around the whole page, and used grey instead of black on the larger letters so they wouldn't take over
    the page. Some of the commas were problematic: when they followed a larger word, they again were intrusive to the neatly right-justified lines. I decided they
    were more visually appealing--if less grammatically correct--following afterwards in the smaller paragraphs.
