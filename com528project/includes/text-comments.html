I chose to highlight certain words in the text that would create an additional message. I did
this by popping out certain of the stronger words: relentlessly, machine-made, non-human facts.

Once I realized I was constructing a Borg-like statement, I decided to make the format as machine-like as possible.
This involved modifying the line height of the larger words so that they still matched the line
height of the paragraphs and playing with the paragraph tracking so that it wasn't disruptive in a fully justified setting.
