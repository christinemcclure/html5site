Continuation of COM528 repo. Folded it into this repo as it will all live in the public_html root of hosting site. 

#TO DO:
1. Write JS function that will resize pages/images on the fly
** Use a fixed width for certain size. No need to keep scaling up
** Disable for less than a certain width
2. Make book pages square. They will display as a rectangle nicely, and fits the square component of many of the exercises.
