    <img class="floatRight" src="/img/fineart/portal.png" alt="construction of portal frame." /><p>This exhibit explored how people experience art. The images were encased in self-lit 6 x 6" boxes, with a large plastic loupe (magnifying glass) mounted to the top. Rather than discretely passing by the images, viewers had to walk directly up to them and peer inside. The images were arranged in groups of three, and let users explore alternate worlds of religion, nature and mythology.</p>

    <h2><strong>Focus</strong> (Religion as barrier)</h2>
    <h3>Jerusalem, Israel</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="/img/fineart/focus-1.jpg" alt="Circular photo. Top half is out-of-focus dark shapes. Bottom half is the top portion of a gate (barrier) in up-close detail" /></li>
      <li><img src="/img/fineart/focus-2.jpg" alt="Circular photo. Top half is slightly out-of-focus dark shapes. Bottom half is slightly out-of-focus gate (barrier)." /></li>
      <li><img src="/img/fineart/focus-3.jpg" alt="Circular photo. Top half shows orthodox Jewish men praying at the Kotel (Wailing Wall) in Jerusalem. Bottom half is out-of-focus gate (barrier)." /></li>
